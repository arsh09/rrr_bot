# This file contains the controller configuration. 

# state controller means it will publish a topic named '/joint_states' 
# which is used by other controller. This topic i.e. /joint_states
# is basically the position, velocity and torque of each joint (in simulation for now)

# this is a position (trajectory) controller controller. 
# Because all three joints are controlled at the same time 
# If you want, you can load controller for each joint separately
